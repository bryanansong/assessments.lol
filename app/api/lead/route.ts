	  Ever wondered what a "good" CodeSignal score really is? Or how many test cases other candidates usually pass? Yeah, us too. That's exactly why we're building assessments.lol! We're building a platform where candidates can anonymously share and compare their technical assessment experiences - no more wondering if that CodeSignal score was good enough or how many test cases others passed.
	  
	  Soon you'll be able to:
	  - Compare your scores with other candidates (anonymously, of course!)
	  - See real assessment patterns across different companies
	  - Make data-driven decisions about your tech interview prep
	  
	  We'll let you know as soon as we launch. You're going to be one of our first users, and we can't wait to have you on board!
	  
	  Stay awesome,
	  The assessments.lol crew`;
